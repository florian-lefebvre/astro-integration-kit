description: Check if a Vite plugin is already present in the configuration
---

`hasVitePlugin` is a utility that checks if a Vite plugin with a specific name is already present in the configuration. This helps prevent duplicate plugin installations and provides better integration development experience.

The `hasVitePlugin` utility allows you to:

- **Check for existing plugins**: Detect if a Vite plugin is already installed before adding it
- **Prevent duplicates**: Avoid adding the same plugin multiple times across different integrations
- **Better error handling**: Make informed decisions about plugin installation in your integration

Use `hasVitePlugin` when:

- Your integration needs to conditionally add Vite plugins based on existing configuration
- You want to prevent duplicate plugin installations
- You need to check if another integration has already added a specific plugin
- You want to provide warnings or different behavior when plugins already exist

## Usage

See [withPlugins](/utilities/with-plugins/) for more details on how to use plugins in your integration.

## Limitations

- **Current integration scope**: `hasVitePlugin` can only detect plugins added from previous integrations, not plugins added earlier in the current integration's setup
- **Plugin order dependency**: When using `hasVitePlugin` within `defineIntegration`, the `hasVitePluginPlugin` must be the first item in the `plugins` array to properly detect Vite plugins within the current integration
- **Name-based detection**: Plugin detection is based on the plugin's `name` property, so plugins without names or with dynamic names may not be detected reliably

## Example

```ts
import { defineIntegration, withPlugins } from "astro-integration-kit";
import { hasVitePluginPlugin } from "astro-integration-kit/plugins";
import someVitePlugin from "some-vite-plugin";

export default defineIntegration({
  name: "conditional-plugin-integration",
  setup({ name }) {
    return withPlugins({
      name,
      plugins: [hasVitePluginPlugin],
      hooks: {
        "astro:config:setup": ({ hasVitePlugin, addVitePlugin, logger }) => {
          const pluginName = "some-vite-plugin";
          
          if (hasVitePlugin(pluginName)) {
            logger.info(`${pluginName} is already installed, skipping...`);
          } else {
            logger.info(`Installing ${pluginName}...`);
            addVitePlugin(someVitePlugin());
          }
        }
      }
    });
  }
});
```
