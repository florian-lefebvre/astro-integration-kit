`defineIntegration` makes creating integrations easier, and adds a few goodies!

:::caution
`definIntegration` is required for All-in mode.
:::

```ts title="my-integration/index.ts"
import { createResolver, defineIntegration, watchIntegration } from "astro-integration-kit";

export default defineIntegration<{ foo?: string }>({
    name: "my-integration",
    defaults: {
        foo: "bar"
    },
    setup({ options }) {
        const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);

        return {
            "astro:config:setup": async () => {
                await watchIntegration(resolve())
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Features

### Options

The `defaults` configuration accepts the default value, it will be deeply merged with
the ones provided by the user. Please note that this is not runtime safe, you'll need
to do so inside `setup`.

### Context & All-in mode

Using `defineIntegration` allows you to go [All-in](/getting-started/usage/#all-in). This means
that Astro hooks parameters are passed to our utilities through Context and you don't need
to pass them manually.

:::note
If you're curious, we're using [`unctx`](https://github.com/unjs/unctx) for this dark magic!
