`addIntegration` allows you to add an integration from within an integration.

It will also do a check using [hasIntegration](/utilities/has-integration) to check whether the integration you're trying to add has already been added. If it has, it won't add it again.

```ts title="my-integration/index.ts" {3,5,13-15}
import {
    defineIntegration,
    addIntegration
} from "astro-integration-kit";
import Vue from "@astrojs/vue";

export default defineIntegration({
    // ...
    setup() {
        return {
            hooks: {
                "astro:config:setup": (params) => {
                    addIntegration(params, {
                        integration: Vue()
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Ensuring unique integrations

By default `addIntegration` will fail if you try to add an integration that's already
been added.

You can bypass this and add it anyway with the `ensureUnique` flag.

```ts title="integration.ts"
addIntegration(params, {
    integration: Vue(),
    ensureUnique: false
})
```
