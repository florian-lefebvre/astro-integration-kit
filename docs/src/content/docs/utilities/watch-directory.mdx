In development, `watchDirectory` will reload the Astro dev server if any files within
the directory has changed. For example:

```ts title="my-integration/index.ts" {4,14}
import {
	defineIntegration,
	createResolver,
	watchDirectory
} from "astro-integration-kit";

export default defineIntegration({
	// ...
	setup() {
		const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url)

		return {
			"astro:config:setup": (params) => {
				watchDirectory(params, resolve())
			}
		}
	}
})
```
