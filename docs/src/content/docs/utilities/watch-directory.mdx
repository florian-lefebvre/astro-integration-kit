In development, `watchDirectory` will reload the Astro dev server if any files within
the directory has changed. For example:

```ts title="my-integration/index.ts" {4,14}
import {
	defineIntegration,
	createResolver,
	watchDirectory
} from "astro-integration-kit";

export default defineIntegration({
	// ...
	setup() {
		const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url)

		return {
			"astro:config:setup": (params) => {
				watchDirectory(params, resolve())
			}
		}
	}
})
```

## Limitations

Those are due to limitations in Astro core:

1. This utility only watches files (as deep as possible) under the specified directory
2. Directories under the specified directory are not taken into account
3. Additions and deletions are not taken into account
