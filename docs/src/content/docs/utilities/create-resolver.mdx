`createResolver` allows you to resolve paths relatively to the integration folder easily. For example:

```ts title="integration/index.ts"
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro"

export default function myIntegration(): AstroIntegration {
    const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);

    return {
        name: "my-integration",
        hooks: {
            "astro:config:setup": ({ addDevToolbarApp }) => {
                addDevToolbarApp(resolve("./plugin.ts"));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This way, you do not have to add your plugin to your package.json `exports`.
