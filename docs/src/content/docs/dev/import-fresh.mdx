`importFresh` imports packages with cache busting for proper HMR during development. Since [This PR in Astro v5](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/11819), bare specifiers are loaded through Node instead of Vite, so they don't refresh when the dev server restarts.

## When to use it

**Use `importFresh` for:**
- All [bare specifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) of your package throughout your entire playground environment (e.g., `"my-integration"`, `"my-integration/sub-package"`)

**Don't use `importFresh` for:**
- Situations where are you 100% sure the import will go into vite module graph and not node module cache, but you can just apply this liberally in your playground because it can be quite painful to determine when it is needed and when it is not.
- In production builds - it is only for playground development 

## How it works

`importFresh` resolves the package path, adds a timestamp query parameter to bust the Node.js module cache, and imports the fresh module.

## Usage

<Steps>

1. **Import the function**

   Import `importFresh` from `astro-integration-kit/dev` in your Astro config:

   ```ts title="playground/astro.config.mjs"
   import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
   import { importFresh } from "astro-integration-kit/dev";
   ```

2. **Use it for package imports**

   Replace regular imports with `importFresh` for your integration packages:

   ```ts title="playground/astro.config.mjs"
   // Use importFresh for bare specifiers
   const myIntegration = await importFresh("my-integration");
   
   export default defineConfig({
       integrations: [myIntegration()]
   });
   ```

</Steps>

## Complete example

```ts title="playground/astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import { createResolver } from "astro-integration-kit";
import { importFresh, hmrIntegration } from "astro-integration-kit/dev";

// Use importFresh for package names to ensure fresh imports
const myIntegration = await importFresh("my-integration");

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [
        myIntegration(),
        hmrIntegration({
            directory: createResolver(import.meta.url).resolve("../package/dist")
        })
    ],
});
```
