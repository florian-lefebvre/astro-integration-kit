description: A utility function that imports modules with cache-busting to ensure fresh imports during development.

`importFresh` is a utility function that resolves a package name and imports it with a cache-busting query parameter to ensure a fresh import that bypasses Node.js's module cache. This is useful during development when you need to reload modules that may have changed without restarting the process.

Because this wraps the import, you'll need to give it the types of the module you are importing. This means you will want to make your playground's config a .ts file.

For relative paths, you must provide `import.meta.url` as the second parameter so paths are resolved from the caller's perspective rather than from the `importFresh` function's location.

## Example

```ts title="playground/astro.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import { importFresh } from "astro-integration-kit/dev";

// Bare specifier 
const { default: myIntegration } = await importFresh<
  typeof import("my-integration")
>("my-integration");

// Relative paths need import.meta.url as second parameter
const { default: localIntegration } = await importFresh<
  typeof import("./integration")
>("./integration", import.meta.url);

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [myIntegration(), localIntegration()],
});
```
