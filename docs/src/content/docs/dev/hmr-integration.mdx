title: hmrIntegration
---

Until now, we recommended `watchIntegration` to enable HMR in development. However:
- This can cause perf issues because paths would be also watched once the integration is consumed from npm
- It doesn't work with a build step, that we highly recommend.

From now on, we recommend that you use dynamic imports in your local playgrounds, alongside the new `hmrIntegration`
exported from `astro-integration-kit/dev`.

```ts title="package/src/integration.ts" del={3-4,10,13}
import {
    defineIntegration,
    createResolver,
    watchIntegration
} from "astro-integration-kit"

export const integration = defineIntegration({
    // ...
    setup() {
        const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url)
        return {
            "astro:config:setup": (params) => {
                watchIntegration(params, resolve())
            }
        }
    }
})
```

```ts title="playground/astro.config.mjs" del={2} ins={3-5,10-12}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import packageName from "package-name"
import { createResolver } from "astro-integration-kit";
import { hmrIntegration } from "astro-integration-kit/dev";
const { default: packageName } = await import("package-name");

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		packageName(),
        hmrIntegration({
            directory: createResolver(import.meta.url).resolve("../package/dist")
        })
	],
});
```
