Astro Integration Kit is a **community-driven effort** to improve the power, flexibility, and, most importantly,
developer experience of creating Astro Integrations.

We are creating the Astro Integration Kit because we want to create a robust, battle-tested suite of tools to make
creating Astro integrations easier in the hopes that one day, this will become part of the core Astro framework.

We constantly gather feedback from the entire community, from first-time integration builders to the seasoned Astro Core team.

Astro Integration Kit is currently an **experimental technology** that's still subject to changes as we solidify the APIs.
However, it was built from techniques used in production-level integrations across the Astro Ecosystem.

Integrations typically require quite a low-level knowledge of Astro and Vite to be made successfully. So, Astro Integration
Kit abstracts a lot of low-level implementation into easy-to-use utilities. Things such as Vite Virtual Modules or creating
Typescript Declaration files for your users.

Small utilities allow you to adhere to best practices with the minimum amount of code.

Once we have a standard way of creating Astro Integrations, we can create content and guides much more easily using well-documented
utilities, enabling more people to create more advanced integrations.
