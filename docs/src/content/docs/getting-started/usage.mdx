Astro Integration Kit can be used in 2 ways: as **extended hooks** or as **standalone utilities**.

## Extended hooks

To define your integration, use the `defineIntegration` utility. You can now register plugins
(we export `corePlugins`) that will add new arguments to the Astro hooks:

```ts title="my-integration/index.ts" "corePlugins" "watchIntegration"
import { createResolver, defineIntegration } from "astro-integration-kit";
import { corePlugins } from "astro-integration-kit/plugins"

export default defineIntegration({
    name: "my-integration",
    plugins: [...corePlugins],
    setup() {
        const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);
        return {
            "astro:config:setup": ({ watchIntegration }) => {
                watchIntegration(resolve())
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Standalone utilities

Use utilities exported from `astro-integration-kit`:

```ts title="integration/index.ts" "watchIntegration"
import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro";
import { createResolver, watchIntegration } from "astro-integration-kit";

export default function myIntegration(): AstroIntegration {
    const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);
    return {
        name: "my-integration",
        hooks: {
            "astro:config:setup": ({ addWatchFile, command, updateConfig }) => {
                watchIntegration({
                    addWatchFile,
                    command,
                    dir: resolve(),
                    updateConfig,
                });
            },
        }
    }
}
```

## Which one should you use?

**Extended hooks** provide a way better DX and we recommend picking this one by default. However, if you have
an existing integration that you want to migrate to `astro-integration-kit`, using **standalone utilities**
will allow you to migrate progressively. Any **standalone utility** is also available as an **extended hook**
argument.
