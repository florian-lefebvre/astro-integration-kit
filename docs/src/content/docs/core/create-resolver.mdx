import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

`createResolver` allows you to resolve paths relative to your integration's location, eliminating the need to manage complex `package.json` exports for file references. It takes a base URL (typically [`import.meta.url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta#url)) and returns a `resolve` function that can create absolute paths relative to that location:


## Usage

We recommend calling `createResolver` in your integration's `setup` function to easily access `resolve` in any hook.

<Steps>

1. **Create the resolver**

   Always pass [`import.meta.url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta#url) to `createResolver` - this is the equivalent of the old `__filename` and ensures paths work correctly regardless of installation location:

   ```ts
   const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);
   ```

2. **Use the resolve function**

   Use `resolve()` with relative paths to reference files in your integration:

    ```ts title="integration/index.ts"
    import type { AstroIntegration } from "astro";
    import { createResolver } from "astro-integration-kit";

    export default function myIntegration(): AstroIntegration {
        const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url);

        return {
            name: "my-integration",
            hooks: {
                "astro:config:setup": ({ injectRoute }) => {
                    injectRoute({
                        pattern: "/my-route",
                        entrypoint: resolve("./pages/my-route.astro")
                    });
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

</Steps>
