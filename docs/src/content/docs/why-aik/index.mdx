Astro Integration Kit is a community-driven effort to improve the power, flexibility and, most importantly, developer experience of creating Astro Integrations.

We are creating Astro Integration Kit because we want to create a robust, battle-tested suite of tools to make creating Astro integrations easier. In the hopes that one day this will become part of the core Astro framework.

We are constantly gathering feedback from the entire community, from first-time integration builders to the seasoned Astro Core team themselves.

Astro Integration Kit is currently an experimental technology that's still subject to changes as we solidify the APIs. However they have been built from techniques in use in production-level integrations across the Astro Ecosystem.

Typically Integrations require quite low-level knowledge of Astro and Vite to make successfully. So Astro Integration Kit abstracts a lot of low-level implementation into easy-to-use utilities. Things such as Vite Virtual Modules or creating Typescript Declaration files for your users.

Small utilities allow you to adhere to best practices with the minumum amount of code.

Once we've got a standard way of creating Astro Integrations we can create content and guides much more easily using well documented utilities meaning more people will be able to create more advanced integrations.
