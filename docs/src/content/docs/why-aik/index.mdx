Astro Integration Kit is a community-driven effort to improve the power, flexibility and, most importantly, developer experience of creating Astro Integrations.

We are creating AIK because we want to create a robust, battle-tested suite of tools to make creating Astro integrations easier. In the hopes that one day this will become part of the core Astro framework.

We are constantly gathering feedback from the entire community, from first-time integration builders to the seasoned Astro Core team themselves.

Astro Integration Kit is currently an experimental technology that's still subject to changes as we solidify the APIs. However they have been built from techniques in use in production-level integrations across the Astro Ecosystem.
