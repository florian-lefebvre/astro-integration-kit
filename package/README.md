## Contributing

This package is structured as a monorepo:

- `playground` contains code for testing the package
- `package` contains the actual package

Install dependencies using pnpm: 

```bash
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
```

Start the playground:

```bash
pnpm playground:dev
```

You can now edit files in `package`. Please note that making changes to those files may require restarting the playground dev server.
